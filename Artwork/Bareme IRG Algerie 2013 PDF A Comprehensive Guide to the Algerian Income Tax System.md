1. Open the PDF file with any PDF reader and locate the table that says "BarÃ¨me de l'impÃ´t sur le revenu global (IRG) applicable aux traitements, salaires, pensions et rentes viagÃ¨res" [^2^]. This is the income tax scale for wages, pensions and annuities.
2. Find your monthly income before tax deduction in the first column of the table. This is the amount that you earn from your employer or other sources before any tax is withheld.
3. Find the corresponding income tax bracket and rate in the second and third columns of the table. This is the percentage of your income that you have to pay as tax.
4. Multiply your monthly income by the income tax rate to get your monthly tax amount. This is the amount that you have to pay or withhold from your income as tax.
5. Subtract your monthly tax amount from your monthly income to get your net monthly income. This is the amount that you actually receive or keep after tax deduction.

For example, if your monthly income before tax deduction is 50,000 DZD, then according to the Bareme IRG Algerie 2013 PDF [^2^], your income tax bracket is 40,001 - 80,000 DZD and your income tax rate is 20%. Therefore, your monthly tax amount is 50,000 x 0.2 = 10,000 DZD and your net monthly income is 50,000 - 10,000 = 40,000 DZD.
 
Note that there are some deductions and exemptions that may apply to your income tax calculation depending on your personal and family situation. For more details, you can consult the document "Manuel d'utilisation de l'application du barÃ¨me IRG" [^1^] or contact a tax professional.
