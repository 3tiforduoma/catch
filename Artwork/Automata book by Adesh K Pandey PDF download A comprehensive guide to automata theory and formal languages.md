### Trial of the Crusader
 
Trial of the Crusader is a new 10/25-player raid dungeon that challenges you to face some of the most fearsome beasts and champions of Northrend[^1^]. You will enter a coliseum built by the Argent Crusade and test your skills and courage against four different encounters:

- Lord Jaraxxus: You will confront a powerful Eredar lord who was summoned by a reckless gnome warlock.
- Faction Champions: You will battle a team of elite fighters from the opposite faction, such as warriors, rogues, mages, priests, and more.
- Twin Val'kyr: You will face two val'kyr twins who wield the powers of light and darkness.
- Anub'arak: You will face the final boss of the dungeon, the ancient Nerubian king who has allied himself with the Lich King.

Trial of the Crusader offers different modes of difficulty and rewards. You can choose between normal and heroic modes, as well as between 10 and 25 players. You can also opt for a more challenging version called Trial of the Grand Crusader, which has a limited number of attempts and higher item level rewards[^1^].
 
Some of the rewards you can get from Trial of the Crusader include:

- Tier 9 armor sets for all classes

To enter Trial of the Crusader, you need to have at least level 80 and a minimum item level of 200 for 10-player mode or 219 for 25-player mode[^1^]. You also need to complete a short quest chain that starts with [The Black Knight of Westfall](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=13633/the-black-knight-of-westfall) for Alliance or [The Black Knight of Silverpine](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=13634/the-black-knight-of-silverpine) for Horde[^1^]. The entrance to the dungeon is located in Icecrown, near the Argent Tournament Grounds.
  
### Isle of Conquest
  
Isle of Conquest is a new 40 vs 40 battleground that pits the Alliance and Horde against each other in a large-scale siege warfare[^1^]. You will fight for control of strategic points on an island, such as a keep, a dock, a hangar, a quarry, and a refinery. You will also have access to various vehicles and siege weapons, such as catapults, demolishers, glaive throwers, cannons, and gunships.
  
The objective of Isle of Conquest is to reduce the enemy's reinforcements
