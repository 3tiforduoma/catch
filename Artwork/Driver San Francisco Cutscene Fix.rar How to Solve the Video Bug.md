# How to Play Total War: Rome 2 Multiplayer with Crack
 
Total War: Rome 2 is a strategy game that lets you command armies and empires in ancient times. It has a single-player campaign mode, but also a multiplayer mode where you can challenge other players online. However, if you don't own the game or want to play it without Steam, you might need a crack to bypass the DRM protection.

A crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that allows it to run without checking for a valid license or online connection. There are different types of cracks, such as SteamFIX, CODEX, or FitGirl Repack, that have different features and compatibility. Some cracks also include DLCs (downloadable content) or updates that add new content or fix bugs.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install Total War: Rome 2 and apply a SteamFIX crack that enables multiplayer mode. This crack works with the Emperor Edition of the game, which includes 17 DLCs and the latest update (v2.4.0.19534). You will also need a Steam account and a friend who has the same crack as you.
 
## Step 1: Download the game and the crack
 
The first step is to download the game and the crack from a reliable source. You can use a torrent program or a direct link to get the files. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive, as the game is about 35 GB in size and the crack is about 9 GB.
 
One of the sources you can use is FitGirl Repack[^1^], which offers a compressed version of the game with selective download options. You can choose which languages and DLCs you want to install, and save some bandwidth and disk space. The repack also includes the SteamFIX crack by Anomaly[^2^], which allows multiplayer mode.
 
## Step 2: Extract and install the game and the crack
 
The second step is to extract and install the game and the crack on your computer. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to unzip the files. After extracting, you will see a folder with the game files and a setup.exe file. Run the setup.exe file and choose the directory where you want to install the game.
 
The installation process may take some time, depending on your system specifications. After it is done, you will see a shortcut on your desktop that launches the game. You don't need to copy any files from the crack folder, as they are already integrated into the game.

## Step 3: Start Steam and login with your account
 
The third step is to start Steam and login with your account. You don't need to own Total War: Rome 2 on Steam, but you need to have it installed on your computer. If you don't have Steam, you can download it from [here](https://store.steampowered.com/).
 
Once you are logged in, make sure your Steam status is set to online. You also need to have a friend who has the same crack as you and wants to play with you. You can invite them to join your Steam chat or voice call.
 
## Step 4: Start the game and host or join a multiplayer match
 
The final step is to start the game and host or join a multiplayer match. You can do this by clicking on the shortcut on your desktop or by running Rome2.exe from the game folder. The game will launch in windowed mode, but you can change it to fullscreen in the options menu.
 
To host a multiplayer match, go to Multiplayer -> Host Battle -> Custom Battle. Choose your faction, map, units, rules, and settings. Then click on Host Game. You will see a lobby where you can invite your friend by clicking on Invite Friend -> Steam Friends -> Select Friend -> Invite.
 
To join a multiplayer match, go to Multiplayer -> Join Battle -> Custom Battle. You will see a list of available games hosted by other players. Look for your friend's name or game title and click on Join Game. You will enter their lobby where you can chat with them and ready up for battle.
